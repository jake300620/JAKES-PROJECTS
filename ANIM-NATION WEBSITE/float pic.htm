                around today with even non anime watchers loving the show</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Released in 2013 and has been shaking the anime world since then, some could even call it a rumbling,
                 one of the very highly rated anime in the new gen era, A must watch.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

        </div>
        <p>One of the less popular animes, but i personally would recommend this anime because of the non-stop action
            and the rescilience of the protagonist of the story. <br> A very good watch in general
